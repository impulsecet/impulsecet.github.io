                        IMPULSE will be a series of exciting events, each 
                        leading to another. The primary goal is to 
                        provide upcoming engineers a peek into state-of-the-art research and industry practices, and to direct them towards it. IMPULSE has 3 broad focus areas, namely Digital Signal Processing (DSP), Machine Learning (ML) and Computer Vision (CV).
                        <br><br>
                        Participants will also be introduced to the 
                        different challenges of IEEE SPS and IEEE CS like ICASSP, ICIP, CVPR and 
                        ECCV. These sessions will be handled by past 
                        challenge winners.
                        <br><br>
                        IMPULSE aims to help students sharpen their 
                        skills in these fields, with proper mentoring. Students can choose from one of the three tracks for learning.
