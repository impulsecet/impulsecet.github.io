            IPULSE hackathon is a 3-day long hackathon, which spans from 28th May 12 AM to 30th May 11.59 PM. <br>
            Your team will be given a problem statement, for which you'll get these three days to solve. <br>
            Solutions can be in any one of these concepts (only). <br>
            <ul> 
                <li>Machine Learning</li>

            [Later this member will be added to a WhatsApp group where directions will be given, which he/she is to inform the rest of the group.] <br>
            Registrations will be done through google forms which will be handed out soon. <br> <br>

            Registration of teams with (only) the participants of the IMPULSE mentoring programme as its members, will be separate from teams which also includes non-participants as its members. <br>
            [i.e., separate google forms will be given to both the groups] <br> <br>

            <b>Note:</b>  Though the registrations for both the groups are separate, the tasks and the judgement will be overall, which is common to both he groups. But participants who were already a part of the IMPULSE mentoring programme may get their own benefits.
