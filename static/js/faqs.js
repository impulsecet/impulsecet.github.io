    {
        q: "How to approach the IMPULSE hackathon?",
        a: `
            IMPULSE hackathon is a 3-day long hackathon, which spans from 28th May 12 AM to 30th May 11.59 PM. <br>
            Your team will be given a problem statement, for which you'll get these three days to solve. <br>
            The code submission is to be done by 6 AM on 30th May. The judges will take a look at your solutions and come up with a shortlisted set of participants who would have to present their solution before the judges on the evening of 30th itself. The presentation would have to consist of a set of slides and you would have to do it orally.<br>

        q: "How to register for the hackathon?",
        a: `Only one member from each team is to register. 
            [Later this member will be added to a WhatsApp group where directions will be given, which he/she is to inform the rest of the group.] <br>
            Registrations will be done through google forms which will be handed out soon. <br> <br>

            Registration of teams with (only) the participants of the IMPULSE mentoring programme as its members, will be separate from teams which also includes non-participants as its members. <br>
            [i.e., separate google forms will be given to both the groups] <br> <br>

            <b>Note:</b>  Though the registrations for both the groups are separate, the tasks and the judgement will be overall, which is common to both he groups. But participants who were already a part of the IMPULSE mentoring programme may get their own benefits.

        q: "What are the criteria to get the certificate of participation in the hackathon?",
        a: `For you to earn a certificate, it is a must for your team to submit a solution to the problem statement.`
    },
    {
        q: "When and where will we get the problem statement?",
        a: `The problem statement will be released on 28th May, at 12 AM (midnight), and your team leader will receive an email that encloses the problem statement at the same time. It will also be published in the Google classroom to which your team lead is allotted.`
    },
    {
        q: "Where to submit the solutions to the problem statement?",
        a: "Solutions are to be submitted through a Google form uploaded in the google classroom you are allotted to.The answer form will contain a field to enter the link to your Github repo or Google Colab where you have collaborated on the code."
    },
    {
        q: "How will I join the google classroom?",
        a: "Only your team leader is to join the google classroom. The link will be sent to the respective person through an email and will also be shared with their WhatsApp group"

        q: "What programming languages can I use?",
        a: "Python, Matlab if needed."
    },
    {
        q: "Should we solve both the scenarios listed in the problem statement?",
        a: "You do not have to solve both the scenarios listed. Choose any one and find a solution for that. You also have the option of choosing a scenario which is not listed and that which pertains to the problem statement and solving that."
    },
    {
        q: "Can we solve ML,CV and DSP together?",
        a: "Yes you may use a mix of ML, CV or/and DSP in solving the problem."
    },
    {
        q: "What is the deadline for submissions?",
        a: "️The solution to the problem statement is to be submitted on 30th May, before 6 AM in the morning."
    },
    {
        q: "Is there another round after submitting the solution?",
        a: "Y️ES!There is one final round left that will be conducted on the same day itself i.e., 30th May [only for the shortlisted teams]. The submissions will be reviewed and a list of selected teams will be published and those teams will have to present their solutions in front of the judging panel (with the help of a ppt)."
    },
    {
        q: "Can we use image processing softwares to solve the task chosen?",
        a: "️YES! You are free to use any softwares, but make sure to keep your solution practical"
    },
    {
        q: "In what format should the solution be submitted?",
        a: "️The solution is to be submitted as program codes."
    },

    },
     {
        q: "What are the points to keep in mind while submission?",
        a: "️You must explain what your solution does and how it can be run or operated, in a README file [ i.e., the instructions to follow while working with your solution]. Try to make your code understandable. But in the end, the practicality and efficiency of your code will be the main parameters taken into consideration.Upload all your files in GitHub and it is enough to share the link to the repo"
    },
    {
        q: "How’s the final round conducted?",
        a: "️Those teams which get selected will have to present their solutions in front of the judges. Explaining the code won't be needed then. Just a ppt with all the necessary details of the project and a knowledgeable presentation will do."
